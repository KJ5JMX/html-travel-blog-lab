    <h2>My time in Colorado</h2>
        <p>Colorado has always been a home away from home. The weather, people and the<br>enviroment are where I thrive. From offroading and camping to hikes
            to a simple <br>old school coffee shop in the middle of historic downtowns. I love it all.</p>

    <h2>Dispersed camping in Colorado</h2>
        <p>My wife and I went to Colorado last year to celebrate our 1 year anniversary. It was a blast but there were some scares along the way.</p>

    <p>I'm not going to lie, it's a little intimidating to go camping outside the normal national and state parks. You loose your <br> sense of safty when it comes 
        to the animals that are around. Always haveing to make sure all of your food is put away is KEY!<br> Our 3rd night there, we were laying in bed and thought
        that we heard something rustling through our camp.<br> It sounded JUST LIKE a bear. I promise. After a little time panicking, I was able to use my flashlight to determine<br> it was 
        just some tarp flapping in the wind. I still just tell people that I am a bear attack surviror. </p>
